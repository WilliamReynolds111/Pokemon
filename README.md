The index.html contains the entry point for a React application, acting as a base template which the react components load from.
Unlike test.html which is an independent web page, index.html does not hold any direct UI elements or scripts for searching for Pokémon.
The script.js contains the operations of fetching Pokémon and has to update the UI in test.html but would have to be changed in order to be incorporated with React.
Meanwhile, styles.css is applied for visual styling on test.html, and index.html relies on React for styling and functionality.
